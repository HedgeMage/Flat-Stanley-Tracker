# Flat Stanley Tracker

## Why?

When my son read [Flat Stanley](http://www.flatstanley.com) for the first time, he wanted to send his own Flat Stanley around the world.  We talked about different ways to make a journal, and he said "Wait, we can make it with [Drupal](http://drupal.org)!"

I didn't have the heart to tell him that the publisher's web site already had an online Stanley gallery.  Plus, it's a great learning project!  So here we go...

## You can do it, too!

This repo contains the entire history of the Drupal-based Flat Stanley Tracker project.  The User 1 account has the user name "Administrator" and the password "justtesting".  These should be changed if you put the Flat Stanley Tracker on the internet, since anyone can do an internet search to find out the defaults.

Have fun!
